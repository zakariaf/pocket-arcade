// Winnability for games that draw their future from the RNG (Line Siege draws its tray and its
// spawns), where no exact search fits. The game's reasonable player (its greedy bot on its own
// evaluation) plays the level from a fixed bot seed; a win is the proof, and its line is replayed
// through the real engine by levelsContractProblems. par is only that line's length: a filter for
// too-short levels, never shown to the player. Stars come from a score rule instead.
