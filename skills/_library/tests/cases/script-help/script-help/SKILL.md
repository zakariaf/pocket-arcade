# Sample greetings

A small, valid skill that the validator self-test changes one rule at a time.

## Rules that must hold

1. **Greet first.** Every greeting starts with "Hello", so the reader knows what it is.

## Workflow

1. Read [references/guide.md](references/guide.md).
2. Copy [templates/greeting.ts](templates/greeting.ts) into the app and fill in the placeholder.
3. Run `node ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check-greeting.mjs greetings` and fix every FAIL line until it prints `RESULT: PASS`.

## Definition of done

- [ ] The greeting is copied and filled in.
- [ ] `node ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check-greeting.mjs greetings` prints `RESULT: PASS`.

## Anti-patterns

- Skipping the guide and guessing the wording.
