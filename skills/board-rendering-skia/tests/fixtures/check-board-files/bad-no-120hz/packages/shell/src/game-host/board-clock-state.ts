/**
 * The board clock's decisions as plain data, so Jest can replay device traces through them.
 * useBoardClock (JS) routes push, stop, resume and every done message through these functions,
 * and the frame runner (UI) asks traceFrameStep and boardFrameOf; nothing here touches Reanimated.
 *
 * Why the JS side keeps its own record: a JS read of a shared value returns the JS thread's cached
 * copy until the UI thread has applied the newest JS write (Reanimated 4.5 mutables). A done message
 * that compared its seq with scene.get() could therefore read the scene from before a push and stop
 * the new scene on its first frame (the frozen board after a rewarded continue, 2026-10-01).
